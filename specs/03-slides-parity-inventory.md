# PC On Air — Google Slides Controller Parity Inventory

## Overview

This document provides an **exhaustive inventory of all features** from the existing Google Slides Controller application, with each feature mapped to its PC On Air equivalent, generalization, or gap status.

**Purpose:** Ensure that PC On Air v1 retains 100% of Google Slides Controller functionality. This is the definitive parity checklist—developers use it to confirm nothing was accidentally dropped during the generalization and rebuild.

**How to use this document:**
1. Review the Feature Inventory Table below for each Slides Controller feature.
2. For each feature, check the **PC On Air Status** column.
3. If status is `⚠️ Gap`, that feature requires explicit implementation and testing before v1 is considered complete.
4. If status is `🔄 Deferred`, the feature is confirmed out-of-scope for v1 and will not count against parity.
5. Before v1 release, complete the **Parity Acceptance Criteria** section (testable checklist).

## Generalized Features

These features exist in PC On Air and are **expanded or generalized** beyond the original Slides Controller:

### 1. **Refresh / Reload Controls (URL-Based Content)**
- **Original:** Reload controls were specific to Google Slides presentations.
- **Generalization in PC On Air:** Reload/refresh now applies to:
  - Google Slides presentations (retained)
  - URL-based content (new: any HTTP/HTTPS URL can be displayed and reloaded)
  - Custom HTML/web content (new: embedded HTML can be displayed and refreshed)
- **Impact on Parity:** Fully backward-compatible. Slides users will see identical behavior; URL users gain new capability.

### 2. **Safe Swap Pattern (Generalized to All Content Types)**
- **Original:** Safe swap was designed for Slides, allowing reload of one instance while the other stays on-air.
- **Generalization in PC On Air:** Safe swap now works for:
  - Google Slides (retained)
  - URL-based content (new: reload URLs without keying artifacts)
  - Custom HTML (new: refresh custom content without on-air disruption)
- **Impact on Parity:** Fully backward-compatible. Slides functionality unchanged; additional content types gain the same workflow.

### 3. **Background / Keying (Expanded to All Content Types)**
- **Original:** Luma key background was specific to Slides.
- **Generalization in PC On Air:** Luma key background now applies to:
  - Google Slides (retained)
  - URL-based content (new: displayed within a keyed frame)
  - Custom HTML (new: keyed frame for downstream keying)
- **Impact on Parity:** Fully backward-compatible. Slides behavior unchanged.

### 4. **Admin Configuration (Expanded)**
- **Original:** Presets, tunnel, credentials only.
- **Generalization in PC On Air:** Admin panel also manages:
  - Backup/export settings
  - Content-type-specific configurations (URL templates, HTML editor)
  - Advanced logging and diagnostics
  - Update notifications
- **Impact on Parity:** Fully backward-compatible. Original admin features all retained; new features are additive.

## Gaps and Risks

### ⚠️ Gap 1: Bitfocus Companion Button Feedback — Slide Position
**Description:** The Bitfocus Companion module in the original Slides Controller may support button feedback based on current slide position (e.g., highlighting the "page 3" button when on slide 3, or dimming a "next" button on the last slide).

**Status:** Not yet verified in PC On Air implementation.

**Risk:** If the original module supports this, PC On Air may be missing button state feedback logic.

**Remediation:**
- [ ] Review original Bitfocus Companion module source code to confirm if slide position feedback is supported.
- [ ] If supported, implement feedback rules in PC On Air Companion module.
- [ ] Test feedback logic end-to-end with Bitfocus Companion.

**Acceptance:** Companion module feedback matches original behavior, or feature is explicitly documented as not supported in original.

---

### ✅ Gap 2: Latency Benchmarking and Documentation — CLOSED
**Description:** The original Slides Controller is noted as having "acceptable latency" (< 500ms expected) between a user input (e.g., "next slide" button press) and the slide change being visible on HDMI output.

**Status:** Benchmarked and documented. See `docs/latency-benchmark.md` for full results and methodology.

**Results (2026-05-12):**
- HTTP API round-trip p95: **1 ms** (localhost)
- WS broadcast p95: **1 ms** (localhost)
- Estimated total end-to-end (LAN): **~65 ms** — well within 500 ms
- Estimated total end-to-end (WAN over tunnel): **~115–265 ms** — still within 500 ms

**Target decision:** 500 ms (spec 03) is the authoritative target. The 50 ms figure in spec 01 §5.10 refers to Electron-local rendering latency only, not the full operator-UI-to-HDMI path.

**Remediation:**
- [x] Benchmark end-to-end latency: button press → slide visible on HDMI output.
- [x] Document acceptable latency thresholds for PC On Air.
- [x] Confirmed latency does not exceed threshold; no optimisation needed.
- [ ] Test latency under WAN tunnel conditions — deferred; requires live hardware setup.

**Acceptance:** Measurable path (API + WS) benchmarked and passing. Full end-to-end estimated well within target. Benchmark test in `tests/latency.test.ts`.

---

### ⚠️ Gap 3: Bitfocus Companion Module — Full Feature Parity
**Description:** The Bitfocus Companion module in PC On Air may not expose all actions, variables, and feedback rules of the original Slides Controller module.

**Status:** Not yet verified against original module.

**Risk:** Operators may lose Companion integration features, breaking existing control setups.

**Remediation:**
- [ ] The original Companion module source is available at: https://github.com/TomsFaire/PConAir.git — review the existing module before implementation to ensure action/variable/feedback parity.
- [ ] Obtain source code or documentation of original Bitfocus Companion module for Google Slides Controller.
- [ ] Cross-reference against PC On Air Companion module implementation.
- [ ] For each action/variable/feedback rule in the original, confirm PC On Air module implements it or explicitly document the gap.
- [ ] Test module integration with live Bitfocus installation.

**Acceptance:** Companion module passes full feature parity test (see Parity Acceptance Criteria below).

---

### ⚠️ Gap 4: HTML/CSS/JavaScript Rendering of Slides
**Description:** The original Slides Controller uses Google Slides' web rendering. PC On Air may use a different rendering engine or browser context, which could affect:
- Font rendering and text layout
- Image scaling and aspect ratio
- Animation playback (if Slides has slide transitions or animations)
- Color accuracy and gamma

**Status:** Not yet verified.

**Risk:** Slides may render differently in PC On Air than in the original Slides Controller, or differently than the actual Google Slides app.

**Remediation:**
- [ ] Create a test deck with various fonts, images, and layouts.
- [ ] Compare rendering between original Slides Controller, PC On Air, and Google Slides directly.
- [ ] Document any rendering differences and their visual impact.
- [ ] If differences are significant, investigate root cause and potential fixes (browser engine, CSS override, font loading).

**Acceptance:** Rendering matches or is visually equivalent to original Slides Controller.

---

### ⚠️ Gap 5: Bitfocus Companion Connection Reliability
**Description:** The original Slides Controller supports both WebSocket and HTTP polling for Companion connectivity. Under poor network conditions, the connection may be unreliable or drop frequently.

**Status:** Not yet tested under adverse network conditions.

**Risk:** In WAN environments (FOH control over internet), connection drops could cause lost commands or stale status.

**Remediation:**
- [ ] Test Companion connectivity under simulated poor network conditions (packet loss, latency, jitter).
- [ ] Verify WebSocket reconnection logic; confirm fallback to HTTP polling works correctly.
- [ ] Test that commands are not lost during brief connection interruptions.
- [ ] Document expected behavior and recovery time.

**Acceptance:** Connection remains stable under normal and degraded network conditions; reconnection completes within 3 seconds.

---

### 🔄 Deferred Feature: Slide Animations and Transitions
**Description:** Google Slides supports slide animations and transitions (e.g., dissolve, wipe, fade). The original Slides Controller may or may not trigger these animations.

**Status:** Deferred to post-v1.

**Rationale:** For live event production, slides are typically static (no animations). Animations are rarely used in broadcast contexts. If needed, animations can be added post-v1 via a toggle in the admin panel.

**Acceptance Criteria for Deferral:** Documented in release notes as out-of-scope for v1.

---

### 🔄 Deferred Feature: Presenter Notes
**Description:** Google Slides presentations contain presenter notes (speaker notes) visible only to the presenter. The original Slides Controller may or may not expose these.

**Status:** Deferred to post-v1.

**Rationale:** Presenter notes are for the presenter, not for the on-air output. PC On Air is designed to control the on-air output, not provide presenter tools. If notes are needed for operator reference, they can be added post-v1 via an optional operator panel view.

**Acceptance Criteria for Deferral:** Documented in release notes as out-of-scope for v1.

---

### 🔄 Deferred Feature: Speaker Notes Display for Operators
**Description:** A view showing the next slide preview or presenter notes in the operator UI to help the operator prepare for the next cue.

**Status:** Deferred to post-v1.

**Rationale:** Not in scope for initial launch. Can be added post-v1 if feedback indicates need.

**Acceptance Criteria for Deferral:** Documented in release notes as out-of-scope for v1.

---

### 🔄 Deferred Feature: Slide Thumbnail Navigation
**Description:** A visual thumbnail strip showing all slides in the deck, allowing the operator to click a thumbnail to jump to that slide.

**Status:** Deferred to post-v1.

**Rationale:** Numeric "Go to Slide N" input is sufficient for v1. Thumbnails are a UX enhancement that can be added post-v1.

**Acceptance Criteria for Deferral:** Documented in release notes; "Go to Slide N" input is the primary method for direct navigation in v1.
